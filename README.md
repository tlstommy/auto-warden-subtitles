Auto Warden Subtitles is a simple Fabric Minecraft mod that enables subtitles when entering the Deep Dark biome. This makes it easier to detect nearby Wardens or monitor the current "warning level" of triggered Sculk Shriekers.

### Sculk Shrieker Warning Levels

Whenever a Sculk Shrieker is triggered or shrieks, the player's "warning level" increases by a value of 1.
When the player's warning level reaches level 4, a Warden is spawned.

While this level decreases over time, it can be advantageous to the player to know which warning level they are currently on. This can be determined from the game's subtitle text, as each individual level corresponds to a specific warning level.

Below is a table of each warning level and the subtitle text that is produced.

| **Warning Level**| **Subtitle Text** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Warning Level 1** | "Warden approaches. " |
| **Warning Level 2** | "Warden advances. " |
| **Warning Level 3** | "Warden draws close. " |
| **Warning Level 4** | "Warden groans angrily. " |
